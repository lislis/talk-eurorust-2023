      Your first time hearing about alt.ctrl?

      --

      This seems nice but very niche?

      --

      Mostly at game jams, festivals or conferences?

      ---

      class: middle

      A lot of alt.ctrl games don't call themselves games!

      ## Rust's ecosystem gives us access to:

      --

      - game engines / cc frameworks

      --

      - hardware / microcontrollers

      --

      - sound / audio

      --

      - lots of protocols

      --

      Case study:

      ## Riding in the park with parrots

      ---

      ## What?

      --

      - alt.ctrl game + uni project

      ---

      ## What?

      - alt.ctrl game + uni project

      - Inspired by that guy cycling <br> with his parrots in<br> Görlitzer Park, Berlin

      --

      - Rail shooter/ balancing game<br> using a real bike handle

      --

      - Mix of 2d and 3d graphics

      --

      - Ultimately tabletop <br> arcade cabinet

      ---

      ## How?

      --

      - Main game written with [bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/)

      --

      - Bike handle equipped with an [ESP32 microcontroller](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board/tree/v1.2)

      --

      - Raspberry Pi to run everything

      ---

      ## Bevy

      --

      - Heard a lot about it, wanted to try it

      --

      - *Really* good tutorials and learning resources 🤩

      --

      -> Highly recommend [youtube.com/@logicprojects](https://www.youtube.com/@logicprojects)

      --

      - So many community plugins 🤩

      --

      - Rapid development 🤩, but materials and plugins are quickly out of date 😢

      ---

      ## Anecdote 1

      --

      I want to directly read serial from the esp32 🤔

      --

      -> There is a plugin, bevy_serial 🥳

      --

      -> bevy_serial is no longer compatible with current bevy version (0.11) 😢

      --

      -> Have game and board communicate over wifi 💡

      --

      -> Write esp32 webserver, change game logic to poll from url (bevy_reqwest) 💻

      --

      -> Wireless controller 🤯 but how to power it 🤔

      ## Anecdote 1

      I want to directly read serial from the esp32 🤔

      -> There is a plugin, bevy_serial 🥳

      -> ~~bevy_serial was no longer compatible with current bevy version (0.11) 😢~~

      -> ~~Have game and board communicate over wifi 💡~~

      -> ~~Write esp32 webserver, change game logic to poll from url (bevy_reqwest) 🐱💻~~

      -> ~~Wireless controller 🤯 but how to power it 🤔~~
      ---

      ## ESP32
      --

      - Standard in the Arduino environment

      --

      - Is Rust on ESP32 hobbyist ready? 🤷

      --

      - Read [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/embedded-rust-esp32c3-board-hands-on-quickstart-guide-cyril-marpaud) and wanted to check out [ESP-IDF template](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template) and [espflash](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash)

      --

      - Start with [esp-rs/std-training](https://esp-rs.github.io/std-training/)

      ---

      ## Anecdote 2

      --

      ESP32-C3-DevKit-Rust-1 comes with cool stuff on the board 🤩 but is kinda pricey 😢

      --

      -> Browsing for a cheap reseller, found really good offer

      --

      -> Board arrives! Setting up the environment 💻

      --

      -> Tooling is awesome 🤩 but I could not get the sensor reading examples to work 😢

      --

      -> Research, trying to find out what's wrong 🤔

      --

      -> Accidentally bought the wrong esp32-c3 board 🤦

      ---

      background-image: url(assets/boards.jpg)

      ---

      ## Anecdote 2

      -> Use different esp32 and gyroscope/accelerometer and fall back to Arduino setup 🫣

      --

      -> Order correct board, wait for it to arrive, start again

      --

      BUT the espflash workflow is still amazing!

      ---

      ## Raspberry Pi

      --

      - Nice to run stuff on for installations in physical spaces

      --

      - Cross-compiling is easy! 🤓

      --

      - ... if you don't have external dependencies 🙀

      ---

      ## Raspberry Pi / Anecdote 3

      - Nice to run stuff on for installations etc

      - Cross-compiling is easy! 🤓

      - ... if you don't have external dependencies 🙀

      ## Raspberry Pi / Anecdote 3

      - Found out about [cross-rs/cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross)

      --

      - So close to configuring it correctly 🤪

      --

      We are game,<br> but you have to make the rest work by yourself!
