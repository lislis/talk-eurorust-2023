      The alt.ctrl scene seems small?

      --

      Mostly at game jams, festivals or conferences?

      ---

      class: middle

      Most alt.ctrl games don't even identify as games!

      ### What's Rust got to do with it?

      --

      # Everything!

      ---

      ## Rust's ecosystem gives us access to:

      --

      - game engines / cc frameworks

      --

      - hardware / microcontrollers

      --

      - sound/ audio

      --

      - lots of protocols

      --

      ## With all of Rust's niceness <3

      ---

      Case study:

      ## Riding in the park with parrots

      ---

      ## What?

      --

      - alt.ctrl game + uni project

      ---

      background-image: url(assets/goerli.jpg)
      background-position: 95% center
      background-size: 50%

      ## What?

      - alt.ctrl game + uni project

      - Inspired by that guy cycling <br> with his parrots in<br> G√∂rlitzer Park, Berlin

      --

      - Rail shooter/ balancing game<br> using a real bike handle

      --

      - Mix of 2d and 3d graphics

      --

      - Ultimately tabletop <br> arcade cabinet

      ---

      ## How?

      --

      - Main game written with [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)

      --

      - Bike handle equipped with an [rust esp board](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board/tree/v1.2)

      --

      - Raspberry Pi as main brain

      --

      - Plywood case and screen to house everything

      ---

      ## How?

      - Main game written with [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)

      - Bike handle equipped with an [rust esp board](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board/tree/v1.2)

      - Raspberry Pi as main brain

      - ~~Plywood case and screen to house everything~~ (not yet)

      ---

      ## Bevy experience

      --

      - *Really* good tutorials and learning resources ü§©

      --

      -> Highly recommend [youtube.com/@logicprojects](https://www.youtube.com/@logicprojects)

      --

      - So many community plugins ü§©

      --

      - Rapid development ü§©, but materials and plugins are quickly out of date üò¢

      ---

      ## ESP32 experience

      --

      - Hard to find the right resources if you're a beginner/ hobbyist üò¢

      --

      -> Start with [esp-rs/std-training](https://esp-rs.github.io/std-training/)

      --

      - ESP32-C3-DevKit-Rust-1 comes with cool stuff on the board ü§© but is kinda pricey üò¢

      --

      - The tooling with espflash is AMAZING ü§©

      ---

      ## Anecdotes pt1

      --

      I wanted to directly read serial from the esp32

      --

      -> bevy_serial was no longer compatible

      --

      -> Have game and board communicate over wifi

      --

      -> Wireles controller üí°, but power supply for the controller ü§î

      ---

      ## Anecdotes pt2

      --

      I could not get the sensor reading examples to work on the esp

      --

      -> Accidentally bought the wrong esp32-c3 board

      --

      -> Used different esp32 and gyroscope module and fall back to Arduino setup

      ---

      ## Anecdotes pt3

      --

      I want 3d environments and benefit from Blender - Bevy compatibility

      --

      -> Need to learn Blender first

      ---

      ## Are we alt.ctrl game yet?

      --

      We are game,<br> but you have to make the controllers work!
